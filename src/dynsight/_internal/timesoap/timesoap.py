    This is optimized to use :func:`SOAPify.distances.simpleSOAPdistance`,
    without calling it.

    .. warning:: this function works **only** with normalized numpy.float64
        soap vectors!

    The SOAP distance is calculated with

    .. math::
        d(\vec{a},\vec{b}) =
        \sqrt{2-2\frac{\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}}{||\vec{a}||\cdot||\vec{b}||}}

    That is equivalent to

    .. math::
        d(\vec{a},\vec{b})=\sqrt{2-2\hat{a}\cdot\hat{b}} =
        \sqrt{\hat{a}\cdot\hat{a}+\hat{b}\cdot\hat{b}-2\hat{a}\cdot\hat{b}} =
        \sqrt{(\hat{a}-\hat{b})\cdot(\hat{a}-\hat{b})} =
        ||\hat{a}-\hat{b}||

    That is the euclidean distance between the versors.

    Parameters:
        soaptrajectory:
            a **normalized** trajectory of SOAP fingerprints, should have shape
            (nFrames,nAtoms,SOAPlenght)
        window:
            the dimension of the windows between each state confrontations.
            Defaults to 1.
        stride:
            the stride in frames between each state confrontation.
            **NOT IN USE**.
            Defaults to None.
        backward:
            If true the soap distance is referred to the previous frame.
             **NOT IN USE**. Defaults to True.
        returndiff:
            If true returns also the first derivative of timeSOAP.

    This function is the equivalent to (old cpctools version below):

    - loading a chunk of the trajectory from a h5py.Dataset with a SOAP
      fingerprints trajectory
    - filling the vector with :func:`SOAPify.utils.fillSOAPVectorFromdscribe`
    - normalizing it with :func:`SOAPify.utils.normalizeArray`
    - calculating the timeSOAP with  :func:`timeSOAPsimple`
      and then returning timeSOAP and the derivative

    Parameters:
        soapdataset:
            the dataset with the SOAP fingerprints
        window:
            the dimension of the windows between each state confrontations.
            See :func:`timeSOAPsimple`
            Defaults to 1.
        stride:
            the stride in frames between each state confrontation.
            See :func:`timeSOAPsimple`
            Defaults to None.
