Vision
======

Code for computer vision and trajectory extraction from experimental videos.

Note that to use this module, you need to install the ``ultralytics`` package.
This can be done with pip::

  $ pip install ultralytics

.. caution::
  Recommended python versions declared by ``ultralytics`` are 3.8 to 3.12.
  Other versions may cause errors.

.. tip::
    ``PyTorch`` is required for the ``ultralytics`` package and its
    requirements vary by operating system and CUDA/ROCm requirements, so
    install ``PyTorch`` first may avoid compatibility issues. Follow the
    instructions at this `link <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>`_
