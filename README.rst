Overview
========

``dynsight`` is structured to support a wide range of tasks commonly
encountered in the analysis of many-body dynamical systems. These tasks
include handling trajectory data, computing single-particle descriptors,
performing time-series clustering and conducting various auxiliary analyses.
To achieve this, dynsight is organized into specialized modules, each
addressing a specific aspect of this workflow.

Previously in `cpctools`_.

.. _`cpctools`: https://github.com/GMPavanLab/cpctools

Installation
============

To get ``dynsight``, you can install it with pip::

    $ pip install dynsight

Optional Dependancies
---------------------

Old versions ``dynsight`` used ``cpctools`` for SOAP calculations, if
you are using Python 3.10 and below, you can use ``cpctools`` to access
``SOAPify`` and ``hd5er`` using ::

  $ pip install cpctools

If you want to use the ``dynsight.vision`` and ``dynsight.track`` modules
you will need to install a series of packages. This can be done with with pip::

  $ pip install ultralytics PyYAML

How to get started
------------------

We suggest you give a read to the ``dynsight.trajectory`` module documentation,
which offers a compact and easy way of using most of the ``dynsight`` tools.
Also, the documentation offers some copiable Recipes and Examples for the most
common analyses.

How to contribute
-----------------

If you make changes or improvements to the codebase, please open a pull request
on our GitHub repository. This allows us to review, discuss, and integrate
contributions in a transparent and collaborative manner. Make sure to include
a clear description of the changes and link any related issues if applicable.


Developer Setup
---------------

#. Install `just`_.
#. Install `uv <https://docs.astral.sh>`_
#. In a new virtual environment run::

    $ just setup


#. Run code checks::

    $ just check

Examples
========

There are examples throughout the documentation and available in
the ``examples/`` directory of this repository.

There are also examples available in the ``cpctools`` repository
`here <https://github.com/GMPavanLab/cpctools/tree/main/Examples>`

Acknowledgements
================

We developed this code when working in the Pavan group,
https://www.gmpavanlab.polito.it/, whose members often provide very valuable
feedback, which we gratefully acknowledge.

Much of the original code in ``cpctools`` was written by Daniele Rapetti (Iximiel).

The work was funded by the European Union and ERC under projects DYNAPOL and the
NextGenerationEU project, CAGEX.
